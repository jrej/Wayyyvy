Battle System Game

This project is a Unity-based battle system game that allows players to engage in turn-based combat, featuring character customization, weapon selection, and a dynamic combat environment. The system calculates combat outcomes using character stats derived from equipped gear, providing a strategic layer to the battle experience.

Features

Turn-Based Combat System: The core mechanic of the game involves turn-based battles, where players select actions for their characters each round.

Character Customization: Players can create and manage multiple characters, each with unique stats and equipment.

Dynamic Weapon and Body Selection UI: Players choose weapons and attack points dynamically through a user-friendly button interface.

Gear-Based Stats Calculation: Character stats (life, force, speed, agility, mana, etc.) are calculated based on equipped gear. This draws inspiration from games like World of Warcraft, where gear impacts character performance.

Experience and Gold Management: Characters gain experience and gold from battles. Functions like BetGold and ReceiveGold are used to manage gold, while GiveExperience is used to update character levels.

Background Variation: Different battle arenas are selected dynamically to provide variety to each fight.

Hero Editor Integration: Characters are visually represented using Hero Editor assets, making the battles visually engaging.

Key Components

BattleHandler

Handles the core battle logic, including initiating fights, determining attack sequences, and calculating outcomes based on character stats.

Background Management: Randomly changes the battle background between different arenas.

CharacterStats
